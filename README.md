# Encord Frontend Challenge

### Instructions to Run the code
1. Clone the repo or extract the archive.
2. Run `npm install` at the root of the project.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the project.
4. Make sure the `db.json` is running through `json-server --watch db.json`. (You might have to install the `json-server` npm package)
5. Play around!



### Notes
- I have assumed things for certain scenarios.
- I had to stick to the challenge restrictions. (I might do things completely different)
